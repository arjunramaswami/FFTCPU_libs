# FFT3d Library Comparison

This repository contains implementations of different FFT libraries in
order to compare their performance with the FPGA implementation.

# Libraries 
These libraries are self composed within their respective folders. The READMEs 
to configure and execute them are also available. 

## FFTW

## MKL

### Configurations
Different configurations using the code:

- FFT3d sizes 
- Forward / Backward FFT
- Precision of floating point numbers : 
- Single Threaded, multi threaded using OpenMP

### Metrics measured

- Runtime (milliseconds)
- Throughput (GFLOPS/sec)
